# Next Generation Web Technologies #

---

A key role of the Applied Innovation team at Kainos is the investigation of cutting edge technologies, with the goal of evaluating the business value for current or future projects. In the past the team have utilised modern browser based functionality with a focus on creating offline web experiences that can compete with native applications like those found on iOS or Android operating systems. This line of research has proven very successful and the underlying technologies are the basis of the research presented in this repository with a new perspective that targets performance and the user experience. To showcase this a series of use cases have been devised which highlight the advantages of applying modern web techniques to real world problems on the web, more on these later.


So what are these mysterious technologies? 


**Service Worker:** This is a script which runs in the background of a web page (Essentially acting as a proxy between the browser and the network) and has to ability to enable offline experiences, intercept network requests and other interesting tidbits that are examined in this repository.
